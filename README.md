# DC4EU Wallet Interoperability Lab Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the DC4EU wallet interoperability
lab setup, developed as part of Work Package 7 (WP7).

The purpose of this repository is to support implementers working with the DC4EU
reference wallet and its integration into a trust infrastructure. The
documentation focuses on the lab environment, configuration, and technical
workflows necessary for credential issuance and presentation within a
cross-border context.

The lab environment is designed to enable end-to-end testing of credential flows
between wallet providers, issuers, verifiers, and supporting trust
infrastructure components (e.g., federation, metadata, trust marks).

This repository includes:

- Technical documentation for the wallet and supporting services
- Integration instructions for test participants
- Configuration guides for setting up the lab locally or centrally
- API usage and credential flow explanations
- Supporting information related to the OIDC-based trust framework used in the
  project

Other documents in the repository provide background and context for the DC4EU
project, its architecture, and its goals.
