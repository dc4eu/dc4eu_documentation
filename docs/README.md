# DC4EU Wallet Interoperability Lab

This documentation describes the setup and structure of the DC4EU wallet
interoperability lab, developed under Work Package 7 (WP7).

The lab environment provides a testable implementation of a DC4EU reference
wallet interacting with a trust infrastructure. It is intended for implementers
working with credential issuance and presentation across wallet providers,
issuers, and verifiers in a cross-border context.
