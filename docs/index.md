# DC4EU Wallet Interoperability Lab

This documentation describes the setup and structure of the DC4EU wallet
interoperability lab, developed under Work Package 7 (WP7).

The lab environment provides a testable implementation of a DC4EU reference
wallet interacting with a federated trust infrastructure based on OpenID
technologies. It is intended for implementers working with credential issuance
and presentation across wallet providers, issuers, and verifiers in a
cross-border context.

## Contents

- Technical architecture and component overview
- Integration flow descriptions (issuance, presentation)
- Configuration instructions for central and local environments
- Usage examples and API interactions
- Trust model documentation (federation, metadata, trust marks)

## Target Audience

This documentation is intended for technical users involved in the integration
and development of digital wallet solutions, credential services, or federation
infrastructure within the scope of DC4EU.

## Repository Scope

This documentation covers the lab environment only. Project-level documentation,
deliverables, and other work package content is tracked separately.

Refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for documentation style and structure
guidelines.
